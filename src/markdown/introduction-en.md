# Jeremy Ye

Hello, I'm Jeremy Ye. Currently, I work as a front-end development engineer in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. I love exploring new and interesting things and enjoy sharing my experiences with others.

I hope to communicate with everyone and grow together.

In my free time, I enjoy singing and traveling, and I prefer the feeling of being close to nature over the hustle and bustle of the city.

Nice to meet you!
