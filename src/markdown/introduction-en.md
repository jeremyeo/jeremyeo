# Jeremy Ye

Hey, I am Jeremy Ye. I am currently working as a front-end development engineer in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province.

I love to explore new and interesting things, like to share some experiences, and hope to communicate with everyone and grow together.

I like to sing and travel, and I prefer the feeling of being close to nature compared to the bustling city.

Nice to meet you!
